<h1>1. Cheap Nature</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The key points I found from this chapter were that capitalism uses nature as an "inexhaustible reservoir for extraction"." By commodifying nature, capitalism causes deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Capitalism has a very different view point than pre-capitalist and indigenous views, which are focused on nature's intrinsic value.</p>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>The authors have told us that capitalism's disregard for nature has had severe consequences and long-term effects. What's next is to explore what we can do to stop these negative changes, and also to go back and use local knowledge that was previously disregarded.</p>

<h3>What have I noticed?</h3>

<p>I've realized that I have to drive somewhere to get to a green space. The realization that how much nature has been commodified made me really upset. It would take me 20 minutes to bike to the shops "nearby" my house. It wouldn't be a nice bike ride either. I'd have to cross a highway, my main path would be alongside a major road. When I visited Amsterdam I became so envious of being able to take a tram anywhere I wanted to go. How many green spaces there that you could walk to. Even trams that would through green spaces. I would really love to have a system like that at home. Where if I needed to go far, I could take a car. However for everything else, a train would be nice.</p>

<p>The quote from 7 Cheap Things says "certainly, previous human civilizations altered their environments. but none were guided and governed by the strategy of cheap nature," this says to me that we are coming to a point where we are only beginning to realize how a lack of quality nature effect us and our ecosystems. "The three processes of cultural apartheid through the Enlightenment, proletarianization, and the privatization of property were at the core of capitalism's cheap nature strategy." The privatization of property really stood out to me here and made me think about how the more costly a piece of land is usually depends on the quality of the nature around it. Which was simply not something that really existed in the past.</p>

<p>I think that going forward we definitely need to fight for more green spaces and more nature in our spaces. Why aren't there trees on the side of highways? or even bushes? What is stopping there from being more nature around us every day.</p>

<h1>2. Cheap Money</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The key point I found from this chapter was that Money is no longer just a way buy and sell goods but is also now used for extracting value from nature and labor. The authors tell us about the history of economy with the rise of colonialism, and the subsequent spread of capitalism.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>The authors have told us how the development of financial systems is connected to colonialism. What's next is to explore alternative economic systems and compare them to our current systems, so that our economy can better serve us.</p>

<h3>What have I noticed?</h3>

<p>We've been hearing all over the news about how inflation is out of control. The inequalities that capitalism have created has expanded to the point where the average person cannot afford a home or a family comfortably anymore.</p>

<p>"Recent bursts of 'land grabbing' of public, peasant, and indigenous land dispossession and privatization, have been accompanied by ocean grabs and even a new space race" This quote shows us how capitalism won't even stop to help the people they're built off of. Instead of ensuring that the people that have to work in the system are treated well, companies are going off and testing space mining in the name of profit. "The IMF had pointed out that systemically big banks- ones 'too big to fail' -already had governments in their pockets. It also reported that the public was being made to pay for lax regulation, which allowed banks to find new ways to sell the credit they created and rely on central government insurance when those bets caused systemic crashes." This quote tells us that without some kind of regulation, the chase for cheaper money will never stop. By abusing relaxed regulation, banks and other corporations are making the world worse for everyone else.</p>

<h1>3. Cheap Work</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The key point from this chapter is about how work has and hasn't changed under capitalism. From slavery, to low-cost labor with poor safety in other parts of the world. Capitalism is constantly searching for cheaper labor. This often exploits racial, gender, and class hierarchies.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>The authors have told us from historical slavery to modern sweatshops that the value of one's work is valued lower than it should be. What's next is to find ways to unionize to ensure that capitalism can't squeeze their money from their workers.</p>

<h3>What have I noticed?</h3>

<p>I was recently helping my boyfriend who lives in Louisiana to find a new job recently. I realized just how undervalued their work is. He makes $12/hour working full time at a gas station. They're cutting hours and becoming stricter on policies he doesn't agree with so we were looking for some new places to apply to and I couldn't find a single job offering over $17/hour. Insane.</p>

<p>"Just as autoworkers on the line assemble simplified, interchangeable parts and fast-food workers manufacture standardized burgers, so did African slaves work specialized jobs in a simplified landscape of sugar monoculture." This quote shows us how little we've done since slavery was outlawed to actually make any progress on having meaningful jobs for people. In a perfect world, the people that wanted to become chefs and create food for others would be doing so because they wanted to. Not because some mega corporation needs a mindless worker there. I'm sure they're already working on automating the entire thing. However the companies are already making hundreds of millions of dollars and not compensating the people that do the work for them fairly. "the creation of modern work happened in Europe through enclosure, a variegated process that transformed human relationships to the rest of nature and to the ways days were spent."</p>

<p>I look at countries that take nap breaks during the middle of the day, or places where everyone has a summer holiday for the entire month of July. Even here at home, some places are trialing and moving to 4 day work weeks. These companies are seeing more work getting done overall as well as happier employees. Which makes me ask why isn't this common place in more places. These people are getting paid fairly, have enough time off to have a proper work/life balance, which makes them happier, which means that overall more work gets done. Why isn't this positive feedback loop happening everywhere?</p>

<h1>4. Cheap Care</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The key point from this chapter is that care has been undervalued by capitalist systems. The devaluation causes poor economic recognition, reinforces inequalities, and marginalizes care. When sidelining care work, capitalism adds strain on people and their communities by not providing proper support systems.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>The authors tell us how care work has been severely undervalued by capitalism. What's next is to understand that care work is essential for other work to continue, and finding what we can do to improve people's health and what we can do to ensure that the people keeping us healthy are properly taken care of.</p>

<h3>What have I noticed?</h3>

<p>My mom is a professor teaching nursing at St. Kates. Not only has the university been really shitty to her when it comes to compensation for her time and dedication, but I've attended multiple nurse picket lines because of how unfairly hospitals and the healthcare system have been treating medical professionals; and from what I can tell, it's only gotten worse since covid.</p>

<p>"The fight to have care work recognized, rewarded, and reduced under neoliberalism becomes yet harder under right-wing economic nationalism." I think this really ties back to the nursing picket lines I've been to. These strikes were all because the hospitals were trying to get their nurses to do more, have more stress, and all for the same compensation as previously. This was endangering the care for their patients which was a loss for everyone. "If the struggles for the recognition, equal distribution, reduction, and compensation of care work are successful, it will be a hopeful sign of the end of cheap nature-and a shift toward valuations premised on care work, not exploitation."</p>

<h1>5. Cheap Food</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The key point from this chapter is how capitalism is constantly on the search for cheaper food. This directly translates to poor economic recognition, worse quality of food, environmental problems, as well as social, and health problems. Capitalism has once again disregards local knowledge, and places profit over sustainability and health of both land and people.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>The authors have told us how in the search for cheaper food, we have experienced the mountain of consequences that come with poorer quality and factory focused nutrition. What's next is to identify what more sustainable, healthier, and quality options exist; and how we can ensure more and more people have access to these foods.</p>

<h3>What have I noticed?</h3>

<p>When the people I know from Europe come to visit the United States, they always are sick for the first week because of how worse the food quality is here than at home for them. We can also look at our own country where obesity is continuing to grow as a problem the worse and worse food gets.</p>

<p>"Capitalist agriculture transformed the planet. Some land became the exclusive domain of specific kinds of crops and crop systems: monocultures were designed to bring in flows of cash." This action alone has made the soil in many places almost unusable. The short term thinking that capitalism brings has once again not seen the long term consequences of it's actions and now is something that needs to be dealt with. "Despite the considerable environmental and governmental subsidies afforded the meat industry, many people are unable to afford its products. For them the private sector and the international development community have offered an alternative: improved nutrition of industrially produced plant based food." I think this is really important going forward. The resources required to make the meat industry possible are too much when we look at the big picture. It's unsustainable to continue growing the production of meats. Looking at vegetable based protein alternatives is something that we should probably be subsidizing instead.</p>

<h1>6. Cheap Energy</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The key point from this chapter is that capitalism is constantly trying to find cheaper energy sources. Recently, coal and oil have been the focal-point of capitalist expansion. This has caused severe environmental damage and has become a catalyst for many geopolitical conflicts. As finite resources deplete, where do we go next and how will capitalism respond to need for sustainable energy.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>The authors have told us how the search for cheap energy has nearly depleted multiple finite resources. What's next is to explore what is possible in the realm of renewable energy, and how we can produce large amounts of energy without causing waste that will negatively harm our future.</p>

<h3>What have I noticed?</h3>

<p>Apple added this "clean energy" feature to their phones recently that tell you how "clean" the energy you can pull from the wall is at any given moment depending on your location. It's much less clean than I thought it was. To be honest I never truly gave it all that much thought, but now that I am thinking about it more, I am happy to know about all the legislation and projects that are happening in Minnesota.</p>

<p>"Cheap oil is so important because today's capitalists don't wish to support the kinds of massive investment that would make a solar transition possible." "Moving away from fossil fuel toward dams still leads to entirely predictable species extinction and may end up increasing greenhouse gas emissions with the decomposing ecology of human-made reservoirs." These two quotes really speak to how urgent and also careful we need to be going forward. I'm glad that there are project to move Minnesota to carbon neutral by 2040. I also realize that we have a very biodiverse state with many habitats for a large range of animals. Ensuring that these systems are not impacted when we make way for new construction of renewable energy sources, is going to be paramount moving forward.</p>

<h1>7. Cheap Lives</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The key point from this chapter is that capitalism, intrinsically, comes with hierarchies. This places values on people's lives that are uncontrollable by the person. This stems from  systemic inequalities, and is perpetuated by colonialism. These hierarchies cause injustices ranging from wage-gaps to human rights violations.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>The authors have told us how capitalism has created many injustices we experience in our every day lives. What's next is to ensure everyone's voice is heard, support decolonial movements, and support the challenging of these injustices big and small.</p>

<h3>What have I noticed?</h3>

<p>I was recently talking about the Overwatch League to someone who had never really heard of eSports before, and they asked if it was a men's league. Which I told them, no it's co-ed but there have only ever been 3 female players in the 6 years of the league's existence. Which has been a fact of life I've lived with for a while, and when the second and third female players were signed I was extremely excited to see them play. However, thinking about it in reflection right now, there are dozens of female player's at the top level of the ranked ladder. Why aren't there more female players in the league? The "under-represented" league ("Calling all Hero's League") is a good start but why isn't there more in the tier 1 league already?</p>

<p>"Strategies that required cheap care and cheap labor produced and reproduced the racial orders by which bodies were read, categorized, and policed at the boundaries of Society and Nature"</p>

<p>"The state manages those lives within that hierarchy, one that presents itself to us and through which we live as a nation. To imagine that white supremacy might be ended by a redefined nation is to misunderstand the series of power operations that have led to the modern form of the nation within capitalism's ecology and to underestimate the historical inertia of the nation-state."</p>

<p>Linking these quotes to my experience above, there's more to white supremacy than just white skin. White supremacy was and is inclusive not just race, but also gender and sexual orientation. It's a thing that affects all of us negatively. It's also a reminder that we will constantly be needing to work on reducing the impact that white supremacy has left and continues to leave in our cultures.</p>
